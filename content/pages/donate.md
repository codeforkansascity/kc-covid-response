## Help KC Make a Comeback Against COVID-19

COVID-19 is hitting our KC region hard, and it is hurting our most vulnerable communities hardest of all. The pandemic is taking a toll in lives, health, businesses, and our sense of community. Comeback KC is a regional public-private partnership in support of a Testing, Tracing, and Supported Self-Isolation (TTSI) strategy to eliminate COVID-19 from the metro area.

We are providing operational support to individual health departments and leadership to build capacity across jurisdictions. Our strength is the ability to put resources to work quickly to address urgent needs and opportunities. We have accomplished a great deal over the past three months with very little. We need your support in order to do more.

Donations to support Comeback KC can be made to KC Digital Drive, the regional civic non-profit that serves as the backbone organization for the public-private partnership. Funds will be used to continue to support both operational and communications aspects of fighting COVID-19. Our operational efforts are focused on building tools, strategy and capacity for testing, tracing, and supported self-isolation. Our communications efforts will continue to provide unified, regional messaging that reaches every corner of our metro, transcending state, county, racial, and political dividing lines. 

Our work is fast and responsive to emerging needs. Unlike traditional non-profit work, our outputs and outcomes will adapt to meet those needs in real time.

KC Digital Drive is a tax-exempt public charity under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. EIN: 46-4502675
