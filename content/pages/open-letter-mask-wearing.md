##### **<center>On Mask-wearing Policies</center>**

July 1, 2020

Like all of you, we are working hard to find our way forward during the midst of a global pandemic and an economic recession. We are looking for safe and sustainable ways to conduct business, serve our customers and clients, and keep our employees employed.

As the science of the pandemic has evolved, we have learned that one of the most important things we can do as business leaders is to require mask-wearing. Several studies in the last month have shown the effectiveness of public mask-wearing in lowering the rates of transmission. Simultaneously, public health officials in Kansas City tell us that workplace transmission is one of the leading causes of community spread here in the Kansas City region.

Mask-wearing mandates have been implemented in some parts of the KC metro area, but not in all. For the good of our customers, our employees, our fellow residents, and our economy, we cannot allow masks to be politicized. We need to establish consistent, metro-wide, mask-wearing in public to protect all members of our communities.

In the interests of keeping our employees, our customers, and our region as safe as possible, we are calling on our fellow business leaders to put in place firm policies that:

* Require employees to wear masks indoors, and require them outdoors if 6' distance cannot be guaranteed;
* Require customers and clients to wear masks in our stores and facilities;
* Provide high-quality masks to employees, clients, and customers who need them.

Business leaders have a unique role to play in shaping and modeling public behavior. By implementing firm mask requirements in our own businesses, we can each do our part to shape and encourage this new habit.

Wearing a mask is a simple, effective practice we can all adopt. It will make our workplace and our region safer, and it will help to prevent the chance of another economic lockdown. We invite you all to join us as signers and to encourage our fellow business leaders to take this step for public health.

Signed,
