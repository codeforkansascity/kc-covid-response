If you need a second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and haven't heard from your original provider and it is beyond the 21 (Pfizer) or 24 (Moderna) days for your second dose or cannot go back to them for some reason, please fill out this form. We will try to find a second-dose provider that may be able to help you.
