Information about COVID-19 vaccinations is hard to come by and changing rapidly. Please check this page for updates to help you get vaccinated for COVID-19 in the Kansas City region.

### State Plans

Vaccine distribution has been delegated to the states, and so each state has its own distribution plan. For regions like ours, having two different plans can be confusing, especially if you live in one state but work in another. To learn about each state's efforts, read the state vaccination plans.
