Information about COVID-19 vaccinations is hard to come by and changing rapidly. Please check this page for updates to help you get vaccinated for COVID-19 in the Kansas City region.

### State Plans

Vaccine distribution has been delegated to the states, and so each state has its own distribution plan. For regions like ours, having two different plans can be confusing, especially if you live in one state but work in another. To learn about each state's efforts, read the state vaccination plans.

### KC Region Vaccinators

**Latest info and sign-up links**

Because vaccine supplies are limited, we encourage you to sign up with as many vaccinators as you may qualify for. This includes filling out the survey or wait-list forms for state and county health departments, as well as pharmacies and hospitals. Grab the first vaccination appointment offered to you, but please don't make actual appointments with more than one vaccinator.

**Kansas City, MO**  - The KCMO Health Dept. is vaccinating high-risk individuals. They are contacting people who have filled out their vaccine sign-up form. The majority of vaccine doses from the state are going to hospitals.

**[Kansas Find My Vaccine](https://www.kansasvaccine.gov/160/Find-My-Vaccine)** - The KDHE does not have a sign-up form, but it does have a Find My Vaccine map feature that shows which vaccinators have received doses each week. You cannot schedule an appointment through this site, however. You must contact a vaccinator to make an appointment.

**Pharmacies**

The [Federal Retail Pharmacy Program](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/retail-pharmacy-program/participating-pharmacies.html) is distributing vaccine doses directly to select pharmacy locations. These locations may change over time, and you will need to be eligible under the state plan in order make an appointment. Participating pharmacies include

**[Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/cp/1228302)**

**[Sam's Club](https://www.kcmo.gov/?splash=https%3a%2f%2fwww.samsclub.com%2fpharmacy&____isexternal=true)**

**[Health Mart](https://www.kcmo.gov/?splash=https%3a%2f%2fwww.healthmart.com%2fstore-locator.html&____isexternal=true)**

Check with individual pharmacies to confirm they are participating and to find out if and when they have appointments available.

**Hospitals**

In Missouri, hospital systems are getting the majority of vaccine doses, so it makes sense to check with those systems, especially if you are a patient of a doctor in their system.

**Truman Medical Centers**

If you meet Missouri's current criteria, you can [register online](https://www.kcmo.gov/?splash=https%3a%2f%2fwww.trumed.org%2fforms%2fcovid-19-vaccine-wait-list%2f&____isexternal=true) or call (816)404-CARE to sign up for TMC’s vaccine waiting list.

**St. Lukes**

Does not have a waiting list or sign-up form. They are notifying patients who meet each state's criteria.  See their [COVID Vaccine Information](https://www.saintlukeskc.org/covid-19/vaccine#) page for more details.

**HCA Midwest**

HCA hospitals are vaccinating patients in accordance with each state's criteria. You must sign up with your local hospital's waiting list. See their [Vaccine Information](https://hcamidwest.com/covid-19/COVID-19-vaccine-information/) page for details and links to the individual hospital sign-up forms.

**KU Health System**

At this time, University of Kansas Health System is not receiving vaccines directly from the state of Kansas. They will reach out to patients when vaccines become available. See their [Vaccine Information page](https://www.kansashealthsystem.com/patient-visitor/covid19-update/covid-vaccine-form) for more details.

**Advent**

There are no vaccine appointments available at this time. See their [Vaccine Info](https://www.adventhealth.com/coronavirus-resource-hub/adventhealth-coronavirus-vaccine-resource-hub) page for more details. You can sign up for vaccine alerts, but the feature wasn't working when we tested it.
