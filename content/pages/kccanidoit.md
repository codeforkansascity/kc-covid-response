We are partnering with[COVIDCanIDoIt?](https://covidcanidoit.com/US/all) to combine their risk-assessment tool with our current Kansas City regional COVID data. This tool provides a real time “risk rating” for common activities. It lets you evaluate the risk of everyday activities based on the actual metrics for four key variables: crowding, droplets, exposure time, and ventilation.
