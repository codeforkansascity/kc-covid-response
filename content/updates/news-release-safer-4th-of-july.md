Based on the organization’s[ Safer Socializing](https://comebackkc.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Comeback+KC+Safer+Socializing+Poster+5.pdf) campaign, these tips reduce the risk of virus transmission while still allowing for in-person socializing. The goal is to help area residents keep themselves and their friends and family safe. The guidelines include:

* Stay home if you feel sick.
* Avoid large crowds; smaller gatherings are better.
* Celebrate outdoors.
* Bring your own food, drink, cups, and dining utensils. Don’t share food or drink.
* Spread out from other people – 6 feet or more is best.
* Wear a mask when you arrive and keep it on when you aren’t eating or drinking.
* Bring your own hand sanitizer and use it before and after you eat.
* Wash your hands when you get home.

“We know Kansas Citians are eager to celebrate over the long weekend,” Tyler Nottberg, Chairman/CEO at US Engineering Co. and one of the leaders of Comeback KC said. “It’s important for everyone to follow these easy, practical guidelines so we can avoid large scale outbreaks and super-spreader events in our community.”

"Right now, there's no such thing as totally safe socializing,” said to Dr. Allen Greiner, a physician and population health expert at The University of Kansas Health System and advisor to Comeback KC. “But we can practice safer socializing to make celebrating the 4th of July as safe as possible."

The group recommends Kansas Citians consider the following guidelines when deciding how to celebrate the holiday:

#### Safest Activities

* Backyard cookout with immediate family
* Family picnic in the park (socially distanced)
* Family movie night (try Independence Day)
* Camping out in the back yard
* Sprinkler / inflatable pool party in the backyard
* Cooking s'mores over the fire pit
* Making traditional 4th of July foods together
* Baking 4th of July cookies or cupcakes
* Going for a walk or hike
* Family bike ride
* Family backyard water balloon fight
* Neighborhood porch BYO block party or picnic (everyone stays on their porch or front yard, but everyone eats at the same time)

#### Safer Activities

* Small backyard cookout, socially distanced, with a couple of friends – everyone brings their own food and drink
* Couples tennis (socially distanced)
* Drive-in movie (bring your own food and drink, bring masks and hand sanitizer in case you need to use the restroom)
* Run a virtual 5K
* Socially distanced walk with a friend (wearing masks)

#### Activities to Avoid

* Large gatherings, such as public pools
* Family reunions
* Crowded public spaces
* Restaurants (indoors)
* Large public firework displays
